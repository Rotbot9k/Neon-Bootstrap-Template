# Neon-Bootstrap-Template
Template version 0.9 build on Bootstrap 4 alpha.

It's my second bootstrap template. 
Inspired Zaki's Abdelmounim photographies and Vaporwave style.

Created with Bootstrap4 alpha. So it's alpha version of this templte,cause for me grid system is not working correctly.
jQuery.smooth-scroll.js and color-animate.js are not created by me,they are ready jQuery tools.
Photos and graphic are used only for present style of template, and non-commercial use.

I was using sass so there are two sass files for view.
